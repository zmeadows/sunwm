$   := future ideas not yet made concrete in any way

***: fix fromJust's and add error handling to dock detection

***: don't remap windows after focus notify (just change focus and update borders)

***: clean up bar code and factor out baroutput class to make it easy to use different bars (dzen2/xmonad/etc)

***: make sure binds relating to multiple screens are only made for existing screens

**: document code better and make README (after version 1 release)

**: add different methods of mouse focusing windows (sloppy, click, none)

**: fix unintended interaction between sloppy mouse focus and workspace changing (simple fix, implement bypasssloppytemp function)

**: let user set how long title cutoff will be

**: make sure bars are not reporting 'enter notify' events. (not certain this is the best way to go about it)

*: go through functions and rename variables to something more sane

**: fix banish (make work right with multiple screens)



$$: remember last frame focused when switching frames (as in i3-wm)
$$$: move mouse cursor to focused screens when changing screen
$$: add support for floating windows (behavior same as xmonad/dwm) (code for this exists in alpha versions of sunwm) (this makes the code wayyyyy more complicated, is it worth it?)
$: visuals to make clear which monitor is focused (change color in bar? blink frame when switching monitors?)
$: write test suite (hunit, quickcheck?)
$: undo system like ratpoison (code for this exists in sunwm alpha code)
$: add support for user-defined hooks (like stumpwm)

DONE:
***: write function to send window to other monitors (shift+win+num) (seriously why haven't i done this yet?)
