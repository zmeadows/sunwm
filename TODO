*   := low priority (bugs that cause superficial issues, features just starting to be added)

$   := future ideas not yet made concrete in any way



***: clean up bar code and factor out baroutput class to make it easy to use different bars (dzen2/xmonad/etc)

***: write function to send window to other monitors (shift+win+num) (seriously why haven't i done this yet?)

***: make sure binds relating to multiple screens are only made for existing screens

**: document code better and make README (after version 1 release)

**: add different methods of mouse focusing windows (sloppy, click, none)

*: refresh/arrange annoyance (barely noticeable window stuttering) bug (seemst to be fixed now?)

$$: remember last frame focused when switching frames (as in i3-wm)
$$$: move mouse cursor to focused screens when changing screen
$$: add support for floating windows (behavior same as xmonad/dwm) (code for this exists in alpha versions of sunwm)
$: visuals to make clear which monitor is focused (change color in bar? blink frame when switching monitors?)
$: write test suite (hunit, quickcheck?)
$: command-line input (like ratpoison's 'colon' command) (is this really necessary or just really cool? or both? ...or neither?)
$: hide windows and display only frame borders during resize? (like stumpwm)
$: undo system like ratpoison (code for this exists in sunwm alpha code)
